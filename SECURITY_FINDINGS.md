# Security Analysis Findings

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-26

## Critical Issues

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability in Cache Deserialization
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/diskanalyzer/service/CacheService.java:141`
**Severity**: Critical

The `FileNodeDeserializer` directly uses paths from JSON without validation:
```java
Path path = Paths.get(obj.get("path").getAsString());
```

**Risk**: An attacker who can modify cache files could inject malicious paths (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`) to cause the application to access or operate on arbitrary system files.

**Recommendation**: Validate and canonicalize all paths from deserialization. Ensure paths are within expected boundaries before use.

### 2. Unsafe File Deletion Operations
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/diskanalyzer/service/DiskScanner.java:152-174`
**Severity**: Critical

The `delete()` and `deleteRecursive()` methods don't validate that files are within safe boundaries:
- No checks to prevent deletion of system-critical paths
- Combined with the path traversal issue, an attacker could potentially delete arbitrary files

**Recommendation**: Add boundary validation to ensure deletions only occur within scanned directory trees. Implement safelist/blocklist for critical system paths.

### 3. Insecure Cache File Handling
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/diskanalyzer/service/CacheService.java:16`
**Severity**: High

- Cache directory (`~/.diskanalyzer/cache`) is created without explicit permission settings
- Cache files could be readable/writable by other users depending on system umask
- No integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to detect tampering

**Recommendation**:
- Set explicit file permissions when creating cache directory (mode 0700)
- Implement cache file integrity checks (HMAC or digital signatures)
- Validate cache content before deserialization

## Medium Issues

### 4. No Boundary Validation for File Operations
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/diskanalyzer/service/DiskScanner.java:179-203`
**Severity**: Medium

The `move()` and `createDirectory()` methods don't verify operations stay within scanned directories:
- Could potentially be used to move/create files in sensitive system locations

**Recommendation**: Implement path boundary validation for all file operations. Ensure operations only affect files within user-selected scan roots.

### 5. Weak Input Validation
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/diskanalyzer/service/FileOperationsController.java:160-179`
**Severity**: Medium

While there is some filename validation, it could be strengthened:
- Doesn't prevent directory traversal sequences like `..` or `.`
- Only checks for invalid characters, not path manipulation attempts

**Recommendation**: Add validation to reject paths containing `..`, `.`, or absolute path indicators.

### 6. Error Messages May Leak Information
**Location**: Multiple locations throughout codebase
**Severity**: Low-Medium

Multiple locations print full paths and error details to stderr, which could leak sensitive filesystem information.

**Recommendation**: Sanitize error messages to avoid information disclosure. Consider logging detailed errors to a secure log file while showing generic messages to users.

2. Add path canonicalization and boundary checks before any file operations
3. Set explicit file permissions when creating cache directory
4. Implement cache file integrity checks
5. Sanitize error messages to avoid information disclosure
6. Add unit tests for security scenarios (path traversal attempts, etc.)
7. Run dependency vulnerability scanner
8. Consider security code review before production release

## Testing Recommendations
